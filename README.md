Game rules:
  To start, the user should type in answers to each of the 3 randomly-generated mini-survey questions. Then they should click on "Add Survey" to post your responses so others may see them. A user may click on the "X" in the bottom-right corner to delete a post. Posts may also be "liked" or "disliked" by clicking on the thumbs up or down button on their card. To reveal the author of a post, hover over the "Who could it possibly be?" button. To see more posts by the same user, click on the revealed username and profile picture.
